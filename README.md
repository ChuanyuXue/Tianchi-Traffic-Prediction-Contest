Update on March 19th. 2021:

When I look through this code written down around 4 years ago, I am kind of impressed. This was the frist time I have tried to involve in a data mining competition, the code is messed up and the result is not proud but it works. The most interesting part is I just use the general Python code to do the complicated feature engineering part without Pandas and Numpy, but the speed and memory cost are both quite good! I must appoligize this code is definately hard to read. Hopefully you can find something helpful from this dirty shit to anything you are working on.

Best,

Chuanyu
